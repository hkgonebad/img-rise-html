                <p>JioWonderland was launched on Christmas Day 2019 by spreading joy
                and celebration with 4000 under-privileged children through the Reliance Foundation ESA initiative.
                The premier night had a robust performance by Guru Randhawa, a special appearance
                by a ziplining Santa and the Hamley’s Grand Parade, premiere night was off to a magical start!</p>
                
                <p>The next 5 days were an escape into Winter Wonderland with exciting attractions,
                choreographed shows, a unique shopping experience and a carnival parade. JioWonderland wrapped up by
                paying tribute to the commitment of the Police Force and the Fire Services Department (FSD)
                of Mumbai with the day dedicated to hosting them and their families.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="jwText ">
                <p>Jio Wonderland hosted over 8000 members of the police, FSD and their families, and
                celebrated the season’s festivities with over 100 enthralling experiences.</p>
                
                <p>This one-of-a-kind family event had something for everyone. From the wonder eye-where,
                you could hop on the Ferris wheel and get a bird’s eye view of the full expanse,
                to India’s tallest sustainable Christmas Tree which promised to be a visual spectacle.</p>
                
                <p>Playtime was never over at JioWonderland with the Hamley’s booth where your buddies and you
                could have the time of their lives. The magical carousel sure promised a joy ride and when in need of a break,
                the shopping market and food court await you. That's not all, because the drone show promised to
                be a mesmerising experience for your eyes.</p>
