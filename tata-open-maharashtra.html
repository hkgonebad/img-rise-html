                        and one of the most prestigious ATP events, attracting the highest ranked tennis professionals
                        from around the globe as well as promising Indian talent.
                        The event took place in January every year and was one of the first tournaments
                        in the tennis calendar.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Chennai Open became an important fixture on India’s international sporting calendar,
                        drawing top players from across the world for 21 long years.
                        Most of them, including Rafael Nadal who has often spoken about its importance in his journey to World No. 1,
                        had made it their first stop every year.</p>
                    
                    <p>India’s Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi forged their formidable partnership at the Chennai Open
                        winning 5 titles together and went on to become one of the greatest men’s doubles partnerships in modern history.
                        The tournament has seen legendary names such as Boris Becker, Patrick Rafter, Yevgeny Kafelnikov,
                        Carlos Moya, Marin Cilic and Stan Wawrinka to name a few.
                        Success at the Chennai Open has been a pivotal stepping stone for some of these players
                        in their rise to the ATP’s elite Top 5 list.</p>
